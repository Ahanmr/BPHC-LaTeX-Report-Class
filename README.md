BPHC-LaTeX-Report-Class
=======================

A template and style file for generating reports / thesis in LaTeX. Specific for BITS-Pilani students

A much more cleaned up version of the class files have been pushed. This version
does a better job of separating the text from the actual formatting than the
earlier version. However, the documentation in Chapter1 has not been updated to
reflect this. Most of the changes are obvious and should not cause problems.

In case anyone has troubles with using this class file, please drop me an email
and I'll be glad to help.
